    <summary>Answer</summary>

    - **Encapsulation** – The Internal representation of an object is hidden from the view outside object’s definition. Only the required information can be accessed whereas the rest of the data implementation is hidden.
    - **Abstraction** – It is a process of identifying the critical behavior and data of an object and eliminating the irrelevant details.
    - **Inheritance** – It is the ability to create new classes from another class. It is done by accessing, modifying and extending the behavior of objects in the parent class.
    - **Polymorphism** – The name means, one name, many forms. It is achieved by having multiple methods with the same name but different implementations.
